                    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                    <p>PassAnyway.com is the web-based evolution of my earlier 'VTU StudyUp' mobile app. The vision is to create a comprehensive, multi-university platform that provides educational resources to a much wider audience. This is a complex, ongoing project that I am passionately developing to tackle the challenges of scaling educational content delivery.</p>
                    <p>The platform is being designed with a sophisticated hierarchical structure to manage content for various universities, semesters, and subjects, including project resources. A key focus is on building a robust and secure system, including features like secure payment processing for premium content.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Key Challenges & Learning</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Scalable Architecture:</strong> Designing a system that can handle a complex hierarchy of educational content for multiple universities.</li>
                        <li><strong>Secure Transactions:</strong> Implementing a secure and reliable payment gateway for accessing premium resources.</li>
                        <li><strong>Audience Growth:</strong> Actively working on strategies to reach a broader audience and grow the user base.</li>
                        <li><strong>Full-Stack Complexity:</strong> Managing the end-to-end development of a feature-rich web application, from database design to user interface.</li>
                        <li><strong>Core Technologies:</strong> (Assuming a similar stack) React.js, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB/PostgreSQL, Payment Gateway APIs (e.g., Stripe, Razorpay).</li>
                    </ul>
