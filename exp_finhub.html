                    <h2>Role & Responsibilities</h2>
                    <p>As the lead developer of FinHub, I was responsible for creating a React-based dashboard designed to act as a financial command center for investors. My primary role was to architect the front-end and manage the integration of various financial APIs to deliver live, actionable market data.</p>
                    <p>I designed and implemented features for portfolio tracking, stock trend analysis, and interactive charting. This project was paused due to the competitive market landscape and lack of a team, but it stands as a significant demonstration of my ability to handle complex data visualization and API integration challenges.</p>
