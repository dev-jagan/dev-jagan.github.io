                    <h2>Role & Responsibilities</h2>
                    <p>As the lead full-stack developer, I took on the personal project of building a complete cab rental web application for a family business. My goal was to digitize and streamline their operations, from booking to dispatch and payment. I was responsible for the entire technical execution, turning a traditional business model into a modern, web-based service.</p>
                    <p>This project involved close collaboration with the business stakeholders to understand their needs and translate them into technical requirements. I designed and implemented a user-friendly interface for customers and a robust backend for managing operations.</p>
