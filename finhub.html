                    <h2>About the Project</h2>
                    <p>FinHub is a sophisticated financial command center I developed to provide investors with a comprehensive, real-time overview of the market. The dashboard integrates multiple financial APIs to deliver live market data, interactive charts, and up-to-the-minute news feeds.</p>
                    <p>The platform was designed to support informed investment decisions by offering advanced features like portfolio tracking, stock trend analysis, a market heatmap, and an economic calendar. This project showcases my ability to work with complex data streams and present them in a clean, intuitive user interface.</p>
