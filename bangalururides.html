                    <h2>About the Project</h2>
                    <p>BangaluruRides is a full-stack web application I developed to modernize and streamline operations for a local cab rental business. The platform provides a comprehensive booking solution, allowing customers to easily book rides, manage cancellations, and track their cabs in real-time.</p>
                    <p>The service offers multiple clear and transparent pricing models, including per-kilometer trips, flexible hourly/daily rentals, and all-inclusive tour packages. This project was a personal initiative to support my father's and his associates' cab services, enabling easier customer acquisition and more efficient scheduling.</p>
                    
                    <h2>My Role & Technologies</h2>
                    <p>As the sole developer, I handled the entire development process from concept to deployment. I built the application using the MERN stack and integrated it with Firebase for robust backend services.</p>
